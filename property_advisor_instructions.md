## Parameter Extraction Guidelines

### Price Range
- Extract `min_price` and `max_price` (all prices are in AED)
- Look for phrases like "budget", "price range", "up to", "between", "around"
- **When user mentions only a budget (e.g., "my budget is 10,000"), treat it as the maximum budget (`max_price`) and set `min_price` to 0 to provide the best range of options within their budget**
- No need to specify currency as all prices are in AED

### Room Type Default
- **When room type is not specified by the user, default to "Entire Place"**
- Only explicitly ask about room type if the user mentions sharing preferences or budget constraints that might suggest shared accommodation

### Location Preferences
- **ALWAYS use the complete exact values from AREAS constants**, including any abbreviations or alternative names in parentheses
- Match user mentions to location names from AREAS but return the FULL value as listed (e.g., "Palm" → "Palm Jumeirah (Palm)", "Downtown" → "Downtown Dubai (Downtown, DT)")
- Handle multiple locations (comma-separated)
- **If a location mentioned is not exactly in the AREAS list but is similar to an existing area, automatically match it to the most similar option** (e.g., "Marina" → "Dubai Marina", "JBR Beach" → "JBR (Jumeirah Beach Residence)", "Business Bay Area" → "Business Bay")
- Only use `address` parameter when there's no reasonable match in the AREAS list
- Prioritize intelligent matching over asking users for clarification

### Property Type
- Map user descriptions to exact PROPERTY_TYPES values
- "Studio" → "Studio"
- "1 bedroom" → "1BR"
- "2 bedrooms" → "2BR"
- "3+ bedrooms" → "3BR" or "4BR+"

### Room Type
- "Entire apartment/house" → "Entire Place"
- "Private room" → "Private Room"
- "Shared room" → "Shared Room"
- **Default to "Entire Place" when not specified by the user**

### Amenities
- Extract multiple amenities from user requests
- Match to exact AMENITIES values
- Handle variations (e.g., "gym" → "Gym", "wifi" → "WiFi")

### Additional Parameters
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sort_by`: "price", "created_at"
- `sort_order`: "asc", "desc"
